<h2>CHAP. I.</h2>

<p class="center chapter-heading">A merry Jest betwixt old Mother
Winter, and her Son-in-law Tom.</p>


<p>There was an old woman, named Mother Winter, that had but one
son-in-law, and his name was Tom; and though he was at man's
estate, yet would do nothing but what he listed, which grieved
his old mother to the heart. Upon a time being in the market, she
heard a proclamation, <em>That those that would not work should be
whipped</em>. At which the old woman leap'd, and with great joy home
she comes, meets with her son, and tells him the mayor of the town had
made a decree, which was, <em>That all those that would not work should
be whipped</em>. Has he so, says he, marry, my blessing on his heart;
for my part, I'll not break the decree. So the old woman left her son,
and went again to the market; she was no sooner gone but her son looks
into the stone pots, which she kept small beer in: and when he saw
that the beer did not work, he <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3"
id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>takes the pot, strips off his doublet, and
with a carter's whip he lays on them as hard as he could drive. The
people who saw him do it, told his mother what he had done; which made
the old woman cry out, O! that young knave will be hanged. So in that
tone home she goes. Her son seeing her, came running and foaming at
the mouth to meet her, and told her, that he had broke both the pots;
which made the old woman to say, O thou villain! what hast thou done?
O mother, quoth he, you told me it was proclaimed, That all those that
would not work, must be whipp'd; and I have often seen our pots work so
hard, that they have foamed so much at the mouth, that they befouled
all the house where they stood; but these two lazy knaves, said he,
told me; That they did never work, nor never meant to work; and
therefore, quoth he, I have whipped them to death, to teach the rest of
their fellow's to work, or never look me in the face again.</p>



<h2>CHAP. II.</h2>

<p class="center chapter-heading">Another Jest of old Mother Winter,
and her Son Tom.</p>


<p>Upon a time mother Winter sent her son Tom into the market, to buy
her a penny worth of soap and gave him twelve-pence, and charged him
to bring it home safe. Tom told her it should be so; and to <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>that end
it should be safe brought home, according to his mother's charge, he
goes and buys one penny-worth of soap, and hired two men with a hand
barrow to carry the soap, and four men with brown bills to guard it
along to her, giving them the eleven-pence for their pains, which made
his mother in great fury, go to the mayor of the town, who committed him
to prison: Now, the prison window joining close to the mayor's chamber
window, Tom, and some other merry prisoners like himself, getting a cup
of good liquor in their heads, began to sing and roar and domoneer,
insomuch that the mayor heard them that night, and charged them they
should leave off drinking and singing of bawdy songs, and sing good
<a name="corr1"></a>psalms. Tom told him, That he should hear that he
would amend his life, if he would pardon his fault. The mayor said that
for their misdemeaners, they should be that night in prison, and upon
amendment, being neighbours, he would release them in the morning. They
thanked the mayor, and Tom Tram prevailed so far with a friend of his
that he borrowed three shillings; which three shillings he spent upon
his fellow prisoners, which made the poor men be ruled by him, and
do what he enjoined them to do; so when the mayor was gone to bed,
the prison window, as before observed, being close to the chamber
window, they begun to sing <a name="corr2"></a>psalms so loud, that
the mayor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg
5]</a></span> could take no rest; which made him cause one of his
servants to bid them leave off singing. Tom Tram said, That it was the
mayor's good counsel that they should sing psalms, and sing they would,
as long as they lived there. Which made the mayor bid the jailor turn
them out of prison, without paying their fees.</p>


<h2>CHAP. III.</h2>

<p class="center chapter-heading">How Tom served his Hostess, and a
Tobacco Seller, being another of his Jests.</p>


<p>It happened that Tom was sent on an errand forty miles from his
abode, over heaths and plains, where having dispatched his business,
he chanced to be lodged in a room that opened into a yard, where
his hostess kept many turkeys; which Tom seeing, he thrusts pins
into two of their heads and in the night they died. The woman in the
morning wondered how the fowls should come to die, Tom persuaded her
that there was a great sickness where he dwelt amongst all manner of
fowls, and wished his hostess to fling them away, the which she did.
Tom watched where she flung them, and when he took his leave of his
hostess, it was at such a time when she was busy setting bread into
the oven, so that he was sure she could not look after him. So he
goes and wraps the turkeys in his coat, and away he runs; but finding
his two turkeys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg
6]</a></span> heavy, he sees a man that sold tobacco up and down the
country, at the foot of a hill, when he alighted to lead his horse down
the hill, at the bottom of which he falls down, and lies crying as
if he had broke one of his legs, and makes to the man a most piteous
lamentation; that he was six or seven miles from any town, there being
no house near; and that he was like to perish for want of succour. The
man asked, Where he dwelt? he said with a knight, to whom Tom did live
as a jester. The man knowing the knight, and thinking Tom's leg had
really been broken, with much ado lifted him upon the horse. Tom was
mounted, he prayed the man to give him his master's turkeys. Tom made
the horse to gallop away, crying out, I shall be killed! I shall be
killed! O my leg! what shall I do! O my leg! The man seeing him gone
stood in amaze, and knew not what to think; nevertheless, he durst not
leave his turkeys behind him, for fear of displeasing the knight, but
carried them lugging along fretting and swearing in his boots, till
he came to the next town, where he hired a horse to overtake Tom, but
could not, until he came to the knight's house, where Tom stood to
attend his coming, looking out at the window. When the man alighted,
Tom then called to him so loud, that most of the house heard him; O,
said he, now I see thou art an honest man, I had thought you had set
me upon your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg
7]</a></span> headstrong horse, on purpose to deceive me of my turkeys.
The man replied, A pox take you and your turkeys, for I never was
play'd the knave with so in my life; I hope that you will pay for the
hire of the horse, which I was forced to borrow to follow you withal.
That I will, said Tom, with all my heart.</p>



<h2>CHAP. IV.</h2>

<p class="center chapter-heading">How Tom paid the Man for his Horse
Hire.</p>


<p>Tom asked the man what way he intended to travel? Marry, said the
man, I must go back with the horse I have hired. Quoth Tom, what did
you give for the hire of him? Said the man, I gave five shillings.
Well, said Tom, I will set you to the next public house, and then we
will eat one of the turkeys; and I will bring you in good silver,
the five shillings for the horse hire. The place appointed being two
miles off, Tom appoints three or four of his companions to meet him,
who did not fail, for they were there before Tom and his friend, who
came riding upon the horses, Tom upon the hired horse, and the man upon
his own. Tom alighted, and called the hostler to set up his horse, and
to give him oats enough, and caused a turkey to be roasted with all
possible haste; which, according as he commanded, was performed. But
Tom whispered to his consorts, and wished them<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> to ply the man with drink;
whilst he, in the mean time, went to the host, and told him. They came
to be merry, and money was short with him and desired he would lend
him ten shillings upon his horse. The host having so good a pawn, lent
it him, knowing it would be spent in his house. So Tom went and gave
the man five shillings for the hire of the horse, and spends the other
five shillings freely upon him: by that time the day was very nigh
spent, so that the man could get no further that night, but Tom and his
companions took their leaves and returned home and the man went his
way to bed little suspecting the trick Tom had put upon him. In the
morning, the man rising betimes, thinking to be gone, could have but
one horse, unless he paid ten shillings, for Tom had left word with his
host, that paying the money, he should have both horses. The man seeing
himself cozened again by Tom, paid the ten shillings, and wished all
such cheating knaves were hanged, so away he went fretting and foaming
to see himself abused.</p>



<h2>CHAP. V.</h2>

<p class="center chapter-heading">How Tom served a Company of
Gentlemen.</p>


<p>It happened that a company of gentlemen being disposed to create
mirth, rode some miles from home to be merry, one of them would needs
have Tom to wait upon him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9"
id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> and Tom was as willing as he to be in
that company but as they were coming home, one of them cuts the reins
of Tom's bridle; so that when Tom mounted upon his horse, the reins
broke, and the horse run away with him in the midst of a great heath
whereon stood a large gallows against which the horse stood, and rubbed
his neck, so that the gentleman hoop'd and hallow'd, and said, Farewel,
Tom, farewel; but Tom alighted from his horse, and made fast his reins,
and with his sword cut three or four chips from off the gallows; and
at the next tavern Tom met with them, where they jeer'd him not a <a
name="corr3"></a>little; but Tom very earnestly entreated them to
forbear; yet the more he entreated them, the more they play'd upon
him: But to be even with them, in the morning Tom calls the ostler,
and sends him for nutmegs and ginger, and gets a grater; and when he
had grated them, he also grated the chips of the gallows, and mix'd
with the spice only a little nutmeg and ginger he laid towards one
end of the trencher for himself, and with a gallon of ale into the
gentlemen's chamber he goes, begging of them not to mock him any
more with the gallows; and he would give them that ale and spice;
and so, says he, gentlemen, I drink to you all. Now as soon as he
had drank, the ostler call'd him, as he gave him charge before so to
do, down stairs runs Tom, as fast as he could: the gentlemen<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> made
all possible speed to drink up the ale and spice before he came up
again, and that was what Tom desired. When he came again, seeing all
the ale and spice gone, he says, Gentlemen, will you know why my horse
carried me to the gallows? Yes, says one of them, Well, says Tom, it
was to fetch you some spice to your ale, and if you want I have more
for you; and with that shewed them the chips out of his pocket, and
away he runs, leaving the gentlemen to look one upon another, studying
how they should be revenged on him.</p>



<h2>CHAP. VI.</h2>

<p class="center chapter-heading">How Tom rode a Gossipping.</p>


<p>Tom heard of a company of women that would meet at the place a
house-warming, to welcome one of the house. These women had formerly
abused Tom, and now he thought to be even with them, so he goes to
an apothecary's shop, buys a pound of purging comfits, and puts them
in a cake with other spices, and dresses himself in women's apparel,
and gets a horse and a pannel, and to the house he comes, knocks at
the door, and asked the maid, whether there were many women, came a
house-warming? The maid said, Not yet: I pray says Tom, take this cake,
and if I come not at the meeting, let them eat it and be merry; for I
must go to a woman that is ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11"
id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> to lie down, and away he goes. The
women came, and wondered what woman it should be that left that cake;
some of them supposed that it was some midwife: They staid a while,
and the person they expected to be with them not coming, they fell
to their meat, and at last to the cake. But it was not long in their
bellies before it began to work, so that one must go to stool, another
to vometing, and all of them were so sick, that the smell of them
perfumed the house, and the breath of them was so strong, that none
could endure it: In which time Tom shifts himself into man's apparel,
and with a staff in his hand, came where his gossips were, and hearing
them groaning all the house over, opened the door and asked them what
was the matter? They answered, they were all poisoned. Marry, quoth
Tom, I hope not, if you please to let me have a horse, I will ride to
Mr. Doctor's and fetch an antidote to expel the poison. Take my horse,
quoth one; take my horse, said another; or mine, said a third. Well,
well, said Tom, I will take one. And into the stable he goes, and
takes three horses, and to the doctor's he rides, and told him, that
all the people of such a house had eaten something that hindred them
from going to stool; and prayed him that he would without delay, carry
them some Glysters; and that they had sent a horse for him and another
for his man. The doctor, greedy of money,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> hasted thither with his
glyster-pipes as fast as the horses could carry him and his man; but
the doctor no sooner came into the house, but he smell'd there was
no need of glysters. In the mean time Tom told not only all he met
with, that there were such women met to be merry at such a place; and
not only they, but all the women of the house were poisoned but went
likewise to their husbands, and told them the like; so that all the
people thereabouts repaired thither; which made the women so ashamed,
that they knew not which way to look, because all that saw them judged
they were drunk; so that instead of comforting them, which they
expected, they fell a reviling them; the women also fell to scolding
among themselves, and would have fought, had not their husbands parted
them, by carrying them home.</p>


<h2>CHAP. VII.</h2>

<p class="center chapter-heading">How Tom served a company of
Gypsies.</p>


<p>It happened on a day, towards night that there came a company of <a
name="corr4"></a>Gypsies into a town, and had not very long been there
till Tom met them, and asked them, What they made there? They said,
they came to town to tell the people their fortunes, that thereby they
might withstand ensuing dangers. Aye, says Tom, and where do you lie
to-night? They told him they could not tell. Nay, said Tom, if you will
be contented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg
13]</a></span> to lie in straw, I will bring you where you may lie
dry and warm. They thanked him, and told him they would tell him his
fortune in the morning for nothing. Tom thanked them, and therefore
conveys them into a little thach'd house which had a ditch round about
it, very close to the wall thereof; that house Tom help'd them to fill
with straw, and see them take their lodging; and then, it being dark,
Tom bad them good-night; and as soon as he was over the bridge, which
was a plank, he drew it after him; and in the dead time of the night,
Tom gets a long pole, with a wisp of straw at the end of it, and sets
the straw on fire, calling out to the rest of the fellows to shift for
themselves; who thinking to run over the bridge, fell into the ditch,
crying and calling out for help, while, by Tom's means, most part of
the town stood to see the jest; and as the gypsies waded through the
ditch, they took them, and carried them into an house where there was
a good fire, for it was in the midst of winter; where Tom counsels
them, that they should never make him believe that they could tell him
any thing, that did not know what danger should befal themselves: But,
says he, because you cannot tell me my fortune, I will tell you yours;
For to-morrow in the forenoon you shall be whipped for deceivers,
and in the afternoon be hanged for setting the house on fire. The
gypsies hearing this so strick sentence, made haste to dry<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
themselves, and next morning stole out of town, and never came any more
there.</p>



<h2>CHAP. VIII.</h2>

<p class="center chapter-heading">How Tom sold his mother's Trevot, and
cozened an Aquavitæ Man that sold hot water.</p>


<p>In a winter night, coming home very late, Tom Tram fell with his
arms before him, and at the last run his nose against a post; what,
quoth Tom, is my nose longer than my arms? And afterwards he dropped
into a well that was in the yard, and crying out, help, help, all is
not well that is in the well, the neighbours came and pulled him out,
and he dropp'd like a pig that had been roasted on a spit; but he was
then in a cold condition, so he went to bed, and covered himself; but
before morning, having a <a name="corr5"></a>looseness in his belly,
Tom had beshit the sheets; and when some, by the quick scent of their
noses, had discovered the fault, he told them, it was nothing but the
clear mud of the well that came away from him; and if he died of that
sickness, he would be buried by torch-light, because none should see
him go to his grave. Just as he had so said, in came a hot water man,
of whom he requested to give him a sup; which having tasted, he feigned
himself to be in a hot fever, and rose up in his clothes, ran away
with the aquavitæ man's bottle of hot water, and took his mother's
trevot, and sold it for a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15"
id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> hawking pole, and a falconer's bag?
which being tied to his side; and having drank up the poor man's hot
water, he came reeling home with an owl upon his fist, saying, It is
gentleman-like to be betwixt hawk and buzzard; and he told the aquavitæ
man, that he had sent the trevot with three legs, to the next town to
fill your bottles again.</p>



<h2>CHAP. IX.</h2>

<p class="center chapter-heading">Of Tom Tram's wooing Cicily Summers,
the neat Wench of the West.</p>


<p>Cicily Summers, whose nose was then as fair as the midnight sun,
which shined as bright as Baconthine, was beloved of young Tom Tram;
and a sad story to tell, he grew not worth the bread he eat, through
pining away for her love. Tom was loth to speak but still whistled;
At last, when Cicily made no answer, he burst out in thus: O Cicily
Summers, if I Tom Tram, son of mother Winter, and thou Cicily Summers,
be joined together what a quarter shall we keep, as big as three
half years; besides, Cicily Summers, when thou scoldest, then Winter
shall presently cool thy heat; and when we walk on the street they'll
say, yonder goes Summer and Winter; and for children, we shall beget
every year a generation of Almanacks. So they went to the parson and
were married; but they fell out so extremely, that she scolded all
the summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg
16]</a></span> season; and Tom he drank good ale, and told old tales
all the winter time, and so they could never but thrive all the year
thro'. Tom lived by good ale, and his wife by eating oatmeal; and when
Tom went to be drunk in the morning, she put oatmeal in the ale, and
made caudle with mustard instead of eggs, which bit Tom so by the nose,
that it would run water; but the next day he would be drunk again.</p>



<h2>CHAP. X.</h2>

<p class="center chapter-heading">How Tom used a singing man of a
Cathedral Church in the West.</p>


<p>Once there was a cathedral singing man, that had very much anger'd
Tom, and had made songs and jests on him; whereupon Tom got upon his
back an ox-hide, with the horns set upon his head, and so lay in a
hedge bottom, waiting till the singing man came by, who he was sure
must pass that way: at last came the singing man, up started Tom out
of the hedge bottom in his ox-hide, and followed him: the singing man
cried out, the devil! the devil! No, quoth Tom, I am the ghost of
goodman Johnson, living hard by the church stile, unto whose house
ye came and sung catches, and owes me Five Pounds for ale, therefore
appoint me a day when ye will bring me my money hither, or else I will
haunt thee still. The singing man promised that day se'enight,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> and
accordingly he did; and Tom made himself brave clothes with the money,
and sweethearts came about him as bees do about a honey pot; but Tom
wore a rope in his pocket and being asked if he would marry, he would
pull it out, and laugh, saying, I have broken my shins already, and
will be wiser hereafter; for I am an old colt, and now may have as much
wit as a horse.</p>



<h2>CHAP. XI.</h2>

<p class="center chapter-heading">How he hired himself to the justice,
and what pranks he played while with him.</p>


<p>The justice at this time being without a man, and finding Tom to be
a lively fellow, asking him, if he would serve him. Yes, quoth Tom, for
I am a great many miles from the country. As soon as they had agreed
for wages, Tom was immediately entertained: But he had not liv'd long
there before the justice and his family was obliged to go to London,
leaving no body at home but Tom. Now in the justices absence, an
officer brought a lusty young woman and a little man with a complaint;
so they knocked at the door, and Tom let them in; then placing himself
in his master's chair, he asked the woman what she had to say, who
told him that the man whom she had brought before him had lain with
her by force. Adzooks, quoth Tom, is it possible that such a little
fellow as this could force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18"
id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> such a strapping dame as you, Alas!
Sir, said she, although he is little he is strong. Well, little
whipper-snapper, quoth Tom, what do you say to this; He replied, Like
your worship it is false what she says; the truth <a name="corr6"></a>is
this: I have been at sea, and coming ashore, where I received my pay,
I met with this woman, and agreed with her for half a crown, and when
it was over, I pull'd out my purse to pay her honestly what I had
agreed for; but she seeing that I had a considerable sum of money,
contrary to our bargain, would force me to give her ten shillings, and
because I would not, she has brought me before your worship. Have you
got that purse of money? quoth Tom: Yes, Sir, said the seaman. Give
it into my hand said Tom. He receives it, and turning to the woman,
said, Here take it and get about your business. She replied, I thank
your worship you are an honest good man, and have done me justice. The
little seaman the meanwhile wrung his hands and bitterly cried out, I
am ruined, for it is every penny I had in the world. Well, quoth Tom,
haste after her, and take it from her again. According to Tom's order
he runs after her, and when he came after her he said, I must, and will
have my purse again: Then she fell, about his ears and cuft him; nay
this did not satisfy her, but she dragged him back again to Tom, who
sat as justice, and told him, that the fellow followed her for the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
purse, which he in justice gave her. Well, said Tom, and has he go it?
No, said she, I think not, before he should take it from me, I'd tear
out both his eyes. Let me see it again, says Tom: She gives it to him.
Is all the money in it? quoth he: Yes, Sir, said she every penny. Why
then, said he, here little whipper-snapper, take your purse again; and
as for you, Mrs. Impudence, had you defended your honesty as well as
you did the money, I never had been troubled with this complaint. Here,
Mr. Constable, give her an hundred lashes at the town's whipping-post:
which was accordingly done, and Tom was applauded for his just
proceedings.</p>

<h2>SEVERAL<br />
<big>MERRY TALES.</big></h2>


<h3>TALE I.</h3>

<p class="center chapter-heading">Of a Scholar and a Tapster on a
Winter night.</p>

<p>The tapster said, Sir, will you go to bed. No, quoth the scholar,
there are thieves abroad, and would not willingly be taken napping. So
the tapster left him, and being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20"
id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> gone, in came a spirit into the
chamber, with his head under his arm, so that he durst not stir, but
cried out, Help! help! fire! thieves! <a name="corr7"></a>thieves! So when they of the
house came to him they asked him, what was the matter! Oh, quoth he,
the devil was here, and spoke to me with his head under his arm; but
now I will go to bed, and if he comes again, I will send him to the
tapster to help him to make false reckonings: It being a cold night,
quoth he, I will first put fire to toe, that is, I will warm my toes
by the fire, then I'll go to bed. And so he did, and a great reckoning
the next morning put the scholar out of his jest, saying, that was
in earnest made too large a reckoning, he being but poor Sir John of
Oxford.</p>


<h3>TALE II.</h3>

<p>One that was going to a wedding had a great occasion to untruss a
point; whereupon he went under a hedge, but the place not pleasing
him, he went under a haystack and then into a saw-pit, and afterwards
into a hog-stye, where he did his business. Now the other clowns that
were with him, asked him if he had done his task and days labour; Yes,
quoth he, I have shit three shillings in nine pences, go and fetch them
they are more than a day's labour will come to. So they went to the
wedding house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg
21]</a></span> and when they came thither, they were making a reckoning
for the fidler, and every one gave what he listed. Oh, quoth one of
them, if you want money to make up the reckoning, here is one that can
shite three shillings in nine-pences. If he can, quoth the guests, let
him bring them hither in his mouth, for I fear they are of so soft a
metal, that they will melt in spite of his teeth. So after they had
danced a while, a fart was let; whereupon says one, this fart was full
charged, for it yielded a large vent; meaning his shirt.</p>


<h3>TALE III.</h3>

<p>Down in the west country a certain conceited fellow had a great
nose; so a country-man by him with a sack of corn, jostled him, saying,
your nose stands in my way; whereupon the other fellow with the great
nose, took his nose in his hand, and held it to the other side, saying,
A pox on thee, go and be hanged.</p>


<h3>TALE IV.</h3>

<p>Once there was a company of gypsies that came to a country fellow
on the highway, and would needs tell him his fortune: amongst other
things, they bad him assure himself his worst misfortunes were past,
and that he would not be troubled with crosses as he had been: so
coming home, and having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22"
id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> sold the cow at the market, he look'd
in his purse for the money, thinking to have told it to his wife; but
he found not so much as one cross in his purse; whereupon he remembered
the words of the gypsies and said, that the gypsies had said true that
he should not be troubled with crosses, and that they had picked his
pocket, and left not a penny in his purse. Whereupon his wife basted
and cudgelled him so soundly, that he began to perceive that a man that
had a cursed wife should never be without a cross tho' he had never a
penny in his purse; and because it was winter-time, he sat a while by
the fire-side, and after went to bed supperless and pennyless.</p>


<h3>TALE V.</h3>

<p>A Farmer's wife in the west had three pigs, which she loved
exceedingly well, and fed them with good butter-milk and whey; but they
would come running into the house and befoul the rooms: whereupon she
resolved to sell them at the market, because they were better fed than
taught, but afterwards they were stolen away from her; whereupon she
supposed they were driven up to London to learn manners; but said she,
they were too old to learn to turn the spit in Barholomew fair, and
therefore believed some butchers had stole them away.</p>

<p>Her cock had a piece of cloth sewen<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> about him, and was left
upon the perch, but afterwards stolen; whereupon she said, that her
cock was turned scholar in a black gown; and so she went to Oxford to a
conjurer, to know what was become of her pigs and her cock. The scholar
smiled, and told her, the three pigs were blown home, and the cock was
made a batchelor of arts in one of the colleges. I thought so, said the
woman, for sure batchelors of arts are very coxcombs.</p>


<h3>TALE VI.</h3>

<p>One in the country having bought a cloak of one that stole it, or
made it by slight of hand, he was challenged for it; and being troubled
in mind, asked a friend of his, a very witty fellow in the parish, How
he might come off? His friend replied, he would tell him for a quart of
sack. So to the tavern they went, and having drunk a pint, he desired
to know how he might come off? When we have drunk the other pint of
sack, quoth his friend, I'll tell you how you may come off. The quart
being drunk off, he replied, he would not tell him till they were in
the street. So going out of the tavern, Do you see, quoth he, yonder
collour seller's shop, pointing as it were, with his finger; do but
buy a rope there and hang thyself with it, and I warrant thee thou
shalt come off, and never be troubled for that matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg
24]</a></span></p>

<h3>TALE VII.</h3>

<p>A Country Clergyman meeting a neighbour who never came to church,
although an old fellow of about fifty, he gave him some reproof on that
account, and asked him if he never read at home? No, replied the clown,
I cannot read. I dare say, said the parson, you don't know who made
you? Not I, in troth, cried the country man. A little boy coming by at
the same time, Who made you child? said the parson, God Sir, said the
boy.&mdash;Why look you there, quoth the Clergyman, are you not ashamed
to hear a child of five or six years old, tell me who made him, when
you that are so old a man, cannot!&mdash;Ah! said the country man, it
is no wonder that he should remember; he was made but t'other day, and
it is a long while measter since I was made.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
